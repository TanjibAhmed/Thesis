# Research-Prism-Based-SPR-Sensor
This code provides the working implementation of the transfer matrix, which serves as the foundational mathematical model for the prism-based SPR sensor. I tried this code for finding the optimal combination of the sensor before running it in the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation software. The main advantage of this code is that it allows testing of every combination within seconds, whereas in COMSOL, each simulation can take hours to complete.
