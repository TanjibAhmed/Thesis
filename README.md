# Research-Prism-Based-SPR-Sensor
This code provides the working implementation of the transfer matrix, which serves as the foundational mathematical model for the prism-based SPR sensor. I tried this code for finding the optimal combination of the sensor before running in the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation software.
